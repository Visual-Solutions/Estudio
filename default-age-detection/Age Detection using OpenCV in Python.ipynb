    "Age estimation can be defined as the automatic process of classifying the facial image into the exact age or to a specific age range. Basically, age estimation from the face is still a challenging problem, and guessing an exact age from a single image is very difficult due to factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions.\n",
